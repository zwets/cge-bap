#
# bap-container-run - run the BAP podman or docker image
#
#   Convenience wrapper for running the cge-bap image.
#
#   NOTE: you will need to set the BAP_DB_DIR and BAP_IMAGE variables
#   below to match your installation, or override them on invocation.
#
# USAGE
#
#   All arguments are passed verbatim to the run command, so this
#   script can be used to run any program on PATH in the container:
#
#       bap-container-run kma_index ...
#       bap-container-run virulencefinder ...
#	bap-container-run blastn ...
#
#   Which of course includes the BAP:
#
#       bap-container-run BAP ...
#
#   When invoked without any arguments at all, this script runs an
#   interactive bash in the container:
#
#       bap-container-run
#       nobody@9febb34:~$ _
#
# SETTINGS
#
#   You must set the following variables to match your installation.
#   Note the ${VAR:-default} syntax means that these variables can be
#   overridden from the invoking shell.
#
# BAP_DB_DIR
# - Must be set to the root directory of the CGE databases.
# - If some databases are located elsewhere on your filesystem, and you
#   don't want to keep two copies, simply 'mount them in' by adding to the
#   run command below: '-v /my/path/to/foofinder:/databases/foofinder:ro'
# - Default is an example path (that I happen to use on my machine).
BAP_DB_DIR="${BAP_DB_DIR:-"/data/cge/db"}"
#
# BAP_IMAGE
# - Change this if you renamed the image or you don't want to run ':latest'
# - Recommendation for a mixed development & production environment:
#   tag the stable release to e.g. 'localhost/cge-bap:prod' and set it here.
# - Default is the name of the image as produced by the build.sh script.
BAP_IMAGE="${BAP_IMAGE:-"localhost/cge-bap:latest"}"
#
# BAP_RUNTIME
# - Set to (optional full path to) the podman or docker command
# - Default is to autodetect the presence of either the podman or docker command
BAP_RUNTIME="${BAP_RUNTIME:-$(command -v podman || command -v docker || true)}"
